# Database-Links
These are some files I made to create a connection with a Movies database on SQL Server I made for IT213

<ul>
<li> The Insert file will let you insert data in Python directly to the SQL Server Table </li>
<li> The return file will retrieve the SQL code and then list it in the output as a tuple </li>
<li> And then the Form_gui file uses Tkinter to make a gui form to make it wasier to inout the data in Python </li>
